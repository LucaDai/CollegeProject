SCENE II. A camp near Forres.
Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, wi
ith Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant
DUNCAN
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his
s plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
MALCOLM
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fo
ought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst lea
ave it.
Sergeant
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The 
 merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon 
 him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smili
ing,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdai
ining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out
t his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd h
him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
DUNCAN
O valiant cousin! worthy gen
ntleman!
Sergeant
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So
o from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner j
justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surv
veying vantage,
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.
DUNCAN
Dismay'd not this
